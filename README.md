# CS1 Kindred Spirit
Kindred Spirit project coded in pure C with no IDE for Computer Science 1

Objectives:
- Design a program that works recursively with binary trees.
- Develop logic to determine if two binary trees are reflections of eachother.
- Develop logic to determine if two binary trees are "kindred spirits".

Program Summary: The program should analyze the structure of arbitrary binary trees in a recursive manner in order to determine various things about them.


Note: These programs from CS1 were critical in my development of C programming skills. I encourage the reader to open the PDF file supplied in this repositiory, or any other repository labeled CS1_, and to browse through the program requirements.
